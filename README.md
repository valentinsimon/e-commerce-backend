# E-Commerce - Back-End development
I developed the Back-End for an e-commerce platform, creating a robust and scalable infrastructure. I used Docker for containerization, ensuring a consistent development environment and simplifying deployment across different environments. I implemented AuthGuard and RoleGuard to handle authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users could access specific functions based on their roles.

For data management, I utilized TypeORM, an ORM that streamlines database interactions and simplifies handling entities and relationships. Additionally, I integrated Cloudinary for efficient image uploading and management, enhancing performance and user experience by enabling cloud-based optimization and storage of multimedia resources.
